# v0.1.2

## Highlights
- CLI reorganized under `src/cli/` with shared help/arg parsing, making subcommands easier to extend.
- `omakure init` now scaffolds scripts with ready-to-run templates (schema + prompts) for Bash/PowerShell/Python.
- Update flow hardened: safer binary replacement, cross-platform download/extract, and automatic script sync from tagged releases.
- Expanded automated tests covering schema parsing, history formatting, and utilities to guard against regressions.

## Added
- Shared CLI helpers and environment help text (`src/cli/common.rs`) reused across subcommands.
- Script templates with schema blocks and prompt handling for new scripts via `omakure init`.
- New utilities: PowerShell quoting, executable permission setter, and temp-dir guard.
- App-specific error type (`AppError`) for future structured error handling.
- Unit tests for domain parsing/normalization, history formatting, util quoting, and error display.

## Changed
- Main entrypoint routes commands through the new `cli` module; per-command parsing moved into dedicated files.
- `update` command now normalizes tags, selects platform-specific assets, installs atomically, and syncs missing scripts from releases.
- System checks use a shared command runner, simplifying messages for git/bash/jq/pwsh/python detection.

## Fixed
- Prevents invalid script paths/extensions during `omakure init` by validating relative paths and allowed extensions.
